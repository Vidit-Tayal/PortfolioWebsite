I am a software engineering student in India, and I’ve identified what I consider to be a small issue in WhatsApp’s current design, which I believe can be easily addressed.  

## Problem:
Many WhatsApp users, including myself, have not updated our profile pictures for extended periods, despite our frequent updates on other social platforms like Meta, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Remarkably, even on a competitive programming website like Codeforces, I find myself changing my profile picture more often.

## Why?

This occurs due to people’s natural tendency to be concerned about their self-image and how others perceive them. On WhatsApp, the challenge stems from the current design, which does not readily prompt users to think about their display pictures.
## Key Idea:

Users inherently care about how they present themselves to others and, importantly, how they perceive themselves.  
The challenge with WhatsApp’s current design is that it doesn’t subtly remind users of their profile pictures, leading to a reluctance to update them. By implementing thoughtful design changes, we can encourage users to refresh their profile pictures, thereby deepening their engagement with the platform.

## Some Design Changes:
**1. Profile Picture Visibility on Home Screen:** To encourage more frequent profile picture updates, we can consider displaying the user’s profile picture on the home screen, possibly at the top right corner. This visual cue will serve as a constant reminder to update profile pictures more regularly.    

**2. Profile Pictures During Chats:** Enabling users to see each other’s profile pictures during conversations, similar to the experience on Telegram, will inject a more personal dimension into WhatsApp conversations.  

## Additional Ideas:
In addition to the profile picture issue, here are some more ideas to enhance WhatsApp:

**1. Seamless Integrations:** Simplify connections between WhatsApp and other Meta-owned services like Instagram, potentially encouraging users to explore paid services/premium features.  

**2. Chat Organization:** Allow users to categorize their chats into sections or folders (like Discord), particularly on WhatsApp Web, where managing numerous conversations can be cumbersome.  

**3. “What’s New” Section:** Create a dedicated section or button to showcase new features and promote premium services. This could pique users’ interest in trying these features.



Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m passionate about software engineering and eager to take on new challenges. I’d love to hear your thoughts on these proposed features.

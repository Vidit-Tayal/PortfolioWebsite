Dynamic Programming (DP) can be confusing for many programmers. The dilemma of choosing between easy-to-write recursive code or faster-executing iterative code often leaves students scratching their heads. Will recursive code always work, or might it lead to TLE/MLE errors? Can every DP problem be cracked using recursion?


## The Challenge:
The real challenge lies in the variety of methods to solve a single DP problem. Some opt for recursive code, others for iteration. Recursion styles varyâ€”some involve helper functions, while others find them confusing. Online educators have their own preferences, adding to the complexity. This lack of a universal method contributes to the confusion.  

In this post, I'll share a simple set of steps that can guide you in solving any DP problem. The key is to focus on the idea behind the solution, not the specific approach (recursion/iteration).


## The Method:
Our goal is to develop an intuition for solving any DP problem. To achieve this, let's understand the four key terms:

- State: Identifying the subproblem.
- Transition: Defining how to solve the subproblem.
- Answer: Determining the final solution.
- Base case: Identifying the smallest subproblem.

## State:


## Transition:


## Answer:


## Base Case:


## Applying the Method - Examples:

**[509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)**  
_The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1._  
_That is,_
_F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1_  
_F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1._  
_Given n, calculate F(n)._  

This is a classic DP problem. Let's solve it using our method.  
**state:** dp[i] = F(i);  
**transition:** dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];  
**answer:** dp[n];  
**base case:** dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1;  

Let's now implement the solution using the calculated terms above:

**[322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)**  
*You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.*  
*Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.*  
*You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.*

## Resources For Mastery:
To gain a more detailed understanding and effectively solve problems, explore the following resources to achieve mastery in this topic:
- **[Priyansh Aggarwal DP Bootcamp At IITGN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAj_13N2fk-RA6wvOUmWOyUeL9zmWFJoI):**  Gain clarity on what 'state,' 'transition,' 'answer,' and 'base case' mean.

- **[Dynamic Programming Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcXpkI9A-RZI-xF76L0sZq_u-k_yHz8pd):** Follow this playlist seriously to master DP. Solve every problem and note down (state, transition, answer, base case) for each.

- **[Further Practice](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0qUlt5H_kiKYaNSqJ81PMMY):** Once you finish the above playlists, explore other good DP playlists (like Striver) for some problem practice. Ensure you apply the new method you've learned.

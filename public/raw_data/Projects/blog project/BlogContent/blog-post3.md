I am excited to share my four-month DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) preparation plan, which I will be rigorously following to secure my dream placement.

## About Me:
I am a pre-final year Software Engineering student at DTU, Delhi. My current CGPA is 8.30 (as of the 4th semester). Here are my current ratings on various competitive coding platforms:

- Codeforces: 1318 (max Specialist: 1430)
- CodeChef: 1561 (max 3 Star: 1603)
- LeetCode: 1782 (max 1782)
- AtCoder: (never participated)

## Aim:
My objective is to secure a placement in a prestigious company by continuous self-improvement. Also, I intend to achieve Expert status on Codeforces and a 4-Star rating on CodeChef.

## Key Areas To Focus On:
- **DSA Mastery:** To solve coding problems during Online Assessments and Inteviews. 
- **Achieving a CGPA of 8.5 or higher:** Recognizing that companies such as DE Shaw, Arcesium, WinZo, Intuit, Siemens, DevRev, Atlassian, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, LinkedIn, PayPal, Samsung, and Walmart apply a CGPA cutoff for on-campus assessments/interviews.

## What I Will Be Doing:
- Following the Striver SDE sheet for coding and maintaining a revision register.
- Participating in every contest on Codeforces, LeetCode, CodeChef, and attempting AtCoder contests (agar mood hua), followed by regular upsolving.
- Improving my portfolio website and adding blogs regularly.
- Study Graphs and Trees again, from a good YouTube channel.

## Summer Holidays:
During my summer break (June - July 2024), I plan to:
- Gain practical experience through a summer internship.
- Brush up on core subjects to excel in upcoming interviews.
- Prepare for resume-based skill interviews, with a dedicated focus on JavaScript, CSS, React, Angular, and API-related interview questions.

## My Suggestions To Juniors For On-campus SDE Intern/Placements:

Some hard-hitting facts:   
- **CGPA Matters (a lot):** Many students, even those unfamiliar with DSA, often secure interview shortlists due to their impressive CGPA.

- **Company-Specific Preparation:** Before taking an Online Assessment (OA) for a particular company, consult peers from other colleges who have undergone the process. Questions tend to repeat.

- **Competitive Programming Helps:** Competitive Programming helps in quickly solving implementation-based problems, proving invaluable for Online Assessments. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my blog. I am passionate about software engineering and eagerly look forward to embracing new challenges. I appreciate any feedback you may have for this post.
